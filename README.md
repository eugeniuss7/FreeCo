# **☕ FreeCo: Brew Connections, Not Just Conversations**
FreeCo is a social discovery platform designed to move digital interactions into the real world. By leveraging the universal "let's grab a coffee" gesture, CoFree matches users based on shared interests and specific topics they are passionate about.

## Motivation
No more endless swiping—just good beans and better breakthroughs.

We built CoFree because we believe the best social network is the one that happens offline. In a world of endless swiping and infinite scrolling, genuine human connection has become a rarity.

Existing apps focus heavily on appearances, leading to shallow interactions and "ghosting." FreeCo flips the script by focusing on Topics and Coffee. By using a low-stakes, universal gesture—"let's grab a coffee"—and centering it around a specific subject (e.g., "AI," "Hiking," "Classic Novels"), we create a natural icebreaker and a purposeful reason to meet. Essentially, it's a free coffee for collaborating.

## ⚡ Quick Start
Get the app running locally in under 5 minutes.

Clone & Install

Bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cofree.git
cd cofree
npm install
Environment Setup Rename .env.example to .env and add your API keys (Database, Maps, Auth).

Bash
cp .env.example .env
Lift Off

Bash
npm start
The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

## 📱 Usage
Once you have the app running, here is the typical flow for a user:

Create Your Profile: Sign up and select your Topic Tags (interests you are knowledgeable about or want to discuss).

Post an Offer: Tap the + button to broadcast a coffee offer.

Example: "Starbucks on 5th Ave • 2:00 PM • Topic: Discussing React Native Architecture."

Browse & Match: Look through the map or list view for offers near you. If you see a topic you like, request to join!

Match Messaging: Once the host accepts your request, a private chat opens. Use this to confirm the table number or exact location.

Meet Up: Enjoy the coffee and the conversation.
